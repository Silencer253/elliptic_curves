Among other things, this allows elliptic curves to be used in cryptography,
usually taking advantage of the difficulty of the discrete logarithm problem
1
for group E(Fq). Because of this application, an important computation for
cryptographic purposes is the cardinality of E(Fq), which also happens to be
the order of the group used for encryption. If the order of the group has small
primes dividing it, then it leads to a weaker encryption scheme. Thus, if one is
going to use elliptic curves for cryptography, it is important to have an efficient
method to test the strength of the encryption scheme for a given curve E over
Fq.
